# SQL - The Complete Guide Course Code

This repository contains the code (the SQL commands) we show in our [SQL - The Complete Guide](https://acad.link/sql) course.

The code / command snapshots are organized into multiple **branches** where each branch represents a different **course section**.

For example, the branch [05-crud](/academind/sql-complete-guide-code/tree/05-crud) belongs to **Course Section 5: "Data Manipulation & Querying: CRUD Operations With SQL"**.

Inside each branch, you find two main folders:

- `/sql`
- `/slides`

`/sql` contains the different SQL commands we execute in the different course lectures of the section to which the branch belongs.

The filenames inside of `/sql` are the filenames you see in the course lectures, hence finding the commands you see in the videos should be easy. 

You can use the command snapshots in this repository to find and fix errors or differences you might have in your commands, when following along with the course.
